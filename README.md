# chat-app
A real-time chatroom web application which features four chatrooms by default, which the users can access and post messages in. Completely coded using vanilla ES6, this web application uses Bootstrap V 4.3 and custom style sheets for styling and interactivity. 

The application uses Google Firestore to store all the chats in the form of dicuments inside a Firestore collection, and makes the calls to the database in realtime.
